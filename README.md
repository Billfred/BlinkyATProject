# BlinkyATProject
This is a project I'm tackling in the course of my work in the South Carolina Assistive Technology Program, part of the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia.

I'll keep the origin story vague for privacy reasons, but the upshot is this: the person that sparked this project needs a pretty big sensory stimulation, but they are also easily upset by most noises and many touch sensations.  Virtually all of our adapted toys rely on either a buzzing motor for motion or a music chip (or both!), so we didn't have a great option.  Light, however, remains an option.

The plan:
* Find an accessibility switch from our collection that's agreeable to them
* 3D print a base for a roughly-tetrahedral set of clear tubes stuffed with NeoPixels -- tetrahedrons should be friendlier to shipping than most other configurations
* Use two NeoSliders as adjustments for brightness and animation intensity
* Wire a headphone jack to an IO pin for switch control.
* Mild stretch goal: use the capacitative touch feature to figure out no-switch control.
